# ObjectRecognizer
Recognition of objects on image (+PyQT5 GUI)

IMPORTANT: This program will not work without model. I am using following model in my code: 
https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI/releases/download/1.0/resnet50_coco_best_v2.0.1.h5
It is not my model, it belongs to Moses Olafenwa (https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses)
Just put it in same folder with script, then compile it, and that should work well.
